Over the edge
Feel like I’m floating
through the air
The pain I felt is paid for
All is said and done, oh
I am restricted
Fixed upon the web
I need to kick the habit
that my mind is breathing in
Break out I’ve got to see
(Break out I’ve got to see)
Spent all my life
holding all of it closely
I played it innocent
A feel of discontent
I’m finally facing it all
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Burning the bridge that keeps us
I’m here
and I’m feeling fearless
Exaggerated that’s
what you assume
The stories over
now I must conclude
I am conflicted
Watching where I stepped
Still hanging in the balance
Not the life I want to live
I want to take it all
Standing tall
Fear outweighed
the person you are
Break out I’ve got to see
(Break out I’ve got to see)
Spent all my life
holding all of it closely
I played it innocent
A feel of discontent
I’m finally facing it all
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
Fearless
