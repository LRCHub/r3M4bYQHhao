I've returned
Beyond the realms of light
Yet I see a tarnished world devoid of life
I recall
In the deeps within the void
Of a greed that grips the hearts of mortal men
To the stars
They colonized our worlds
And a vast machine has caged our dying sun!

All around the winded spires
There I did arise
Where the oceans that once churned
The sands replaced in time
All the ones I've known and loved
Have passed so long ago
And their distant echoed voices
Trapped within the stone
The imposing fortress
Lines the outer wall
By my hand I swear
I will bring its fall!

Power-hungry tyrants hailing
From a distant star
A disregard for life!
On the worlds eclipsed by war

Trekking down the barren road
To where the great ships loom
Starlifters set to launch
To spell the planet's doom

Calling ancient wisdom
Present evermore
For my name is Fearless
And this world shall be restored

Wicked engines wheeling
Through the dizzying abyss
Riding silver flames
Into the great beyond

Through vast oceans of space
I sail across the stars
To rout the Syndicate
Before the dawning war

Steal into the brig
Encounter the machine
Risking everything
I recognize
The artificial prisoner
Held against its will
Destroying outer worlds
To turn the planets still
Two minds combined into
The integrated whole
Synaptic matrices
I must take control

In the dark
A cold machine
I am
I am lost
But I see
I transcend
This mortal shell
And I await the reckoning
If life is a wheel
Please let it spin...

Event Horizon
Point of no return
Black hole!!
Machine Messiah
One-one zero-zero
Sail into the point
Of no return!!
